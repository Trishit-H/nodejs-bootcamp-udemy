        "bookName": "Animal Farm",
        "authorName": "George Orwell",
        "description": "In George Orwell's 'Animal Farm,' a group of farm animals led by two pigs, Snowball and Napoleon, revolt against their oppressive human owner, Mr. Jones, in hopes of establishing an egalitarian society. However, as the pigs gain power, the initial ideals of equality and freedom are corrupted. Napoleon seizes control, expelling Snowball, and gradually becomes a dictator. The farm's new government mirrors the rise of Stalinism in the Soviet Union, as the pigs begin to resemble the very humans they overthrew. Orwell’s novella is a sharp and insightful political allegory, exposing the dangers of totalitarianism and the betrayal of revolutionary ideals. Through the fate of the farm, Orwell illustrates how power can corrupt, and how those in power often manipulate language and truth to maintain control. 'Animal Farm' remains a powerful commentary on the cyclical nature of tyranny and the fragility of freedom.",
